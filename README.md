# Advanced AI Voice Chatbot

This project is a sophisticated, command-line conversational AI that leverages a local Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning and the ElevenLabs API for high-quality, real-time voice synthesis. It features a persistent memory system backed by a SQLite database, allowing it to learn and recall previous conversations using semantic search.

This chatbot is designed to run on a local machine with GPU acceleration for fast and efficient LLM inference.

## Features

-   **Local LLM Inference:** Utilizes `llama-cpp-python` to run powerful GGUF-format language models (e.g., WizardLM, Mistral) locally with full GPU offloading.
-   **High-Quality, Real-Time TTS:** Integrates with the **ElevenLabs API** to provide natural, studio-quality voice responses with minimal latency.
-   **Persistent Memory:** Remembers past questions and answers in a SQLite database (`memory.db`), allowing it to learn over time.
-   **Semantic Search:** Employs `spaCy`'s language models to find answers to semantically similar questions in its memory, rather than just exact matches.
-   **Asynchronous Audio:** The bot responds instantly with text in the console while the audio is generated and played in the background, creating a highly responsive user experience.
-   **Advanced Text Normalization:** A custom pre-processing step expands abbreviations (e.g., "km"), symbols (e.g., "-"), and special characters (e.g., "Â²") into full words for clear and accurate pronunciation.

## Technology Stack

-   **Language:** Python 3.12
-   **LLM Backend:** `llama-cpp-python`
-   **TTS Backend:** ElevenLabs API
-   **NLP / Search:** `spaCy`
-   **Database:** SQLite
